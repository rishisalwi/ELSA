# Electromagnetic Levitation Stabilization Apparatus (ELSA)
Electromagnetic Levitation Stabilization Apparatus
This project aims to stabilize objects during earthquakes. Four electromagnets act as pillars to levitate a platfor based on accelerometer feedback. This keeps the platform flat regardless of any external movement.
